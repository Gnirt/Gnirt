# README: Gnirt's (poignant) Guide to Work

This is a simple manifesto for my co-workers. I hope it will help us work better together.

`Disclaimer` I strive to stay aligned with what I wrote below. If you feel like I am acting in a way that contradicts the following manifest, I'd be grateful if you’d let me know.

Practice makes perfect, but I can't practice what I’m unaware of.

## 2026 professional goal

> Being call a senior ruby developer without feeling the impostor syndrome.

Currently a mid-tier developer. After having the first years of bliss, I feel that I’ve been stagnant in my progress. It is time to push myself by tackling scaling challenges, within a team of people who are more skilled than I am, and regularly solving development riddles on the vast internet.

## People first
What I value the most at work is the social bond we create when working together towards a common goal.
I won't remember the feature, nor the code. But I'll remember the people, our smiles and struggles while building our project. I like creating deep connections with people I'll be happy to hear about or hang out with going forward.

To fulfill that purpose, I spontaneously propose getting coffee with new and older faces.

## Feedback makes perfect
- Feeling down for a few days happens, but feeling so for 2 weeks is, in my case, a warning. I'll openly talk about it with my manager to find root causes/solutions and communicate about it at an early stage. If you get the impression that I've been feeling down for a while, please notify me. I'll gladly ponder the last few days.
- In case of positive feedback, I prefer private praise and feel awkward with public ones

## When in doubt, I'll ask
> I'm not omnipotent.

- I might learn too late that I was lacking context or knowledge about the scope of a project. I'll openly say I was wrong and rephrase my new position.
- If I say something that might have offended someone and I have second thoughts about something I said, I'll DM the person to ask whether I crossed any boundary and tell them not to hesitate to let me know if I did. I'll apologize, learn and try my best not to make that mistake again.

## Listen, speak, wait
> 3 principles for a great conversation:

1. Listen, do not interrupt
2. Say what you need to say
3. Create silence for the other person to speak

I tend to be more on the introverted side, and I believe a healthy conversation should be one where we listen to each other. When paired with people more extraverted, I have a hard time finding the silence needed to jump in and present my thoughts.

## Quirks
- My phone doesn't have data. My manager’s number is set to favorite and will ring even if my phone is on silent mode. Please call me for any emergency.
- Work & social are both needed. Please let me know if I joked at the wrong place or should stop my current task to enjoy the meeting.
- My brain thinks best is in the morning, right after my coffee. I (usually) wake up early and go to sleep early. I take a 2-hour lunch two times a week to do my physical training, it's important to me.
- I'm relaxed, which can cause people to perceive me as nonchalant. If you feel this way please tell me, I'm committed to providing the best of myself and I would hate to let my team down.
- Once a task is in my ownership, expect me to follow up. If a task is assigned to me, I will note it in my system. If I need assistance, if the task is delayed or done, I'll let you know.
- I value time, therefore I'm not verbose in my oral descriptions. I assume people ask when they need more details. But if that’s not the case for you, please tell me, I'll try my best to adapt. On the opposite when typing, I try to have the right amount of precision and simplicity, to avoid back and forth and wasted time.
